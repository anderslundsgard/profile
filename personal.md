I'm a software craftsman with a passion for code of all kinds. After a dozen of years being an engineer in an Enterprise I not only have produced a ton of code, I also found the joy to make the code run reliably on it's production infrastructure. To many this might not sound that fancy, but since I for years struggled with ordering infrastructure for my apps on an On-Premise hosting, it has been a pleasant journey to experience the many possibilities with public cloud alternatives.  

I live with my wife Amanda in Nykvarn where we in January 2021 bought a house. We enjoy our family life raising our two children Tilda (2012) and Teo (2015).  

I'm a big fan of Formula 1 and hopefully soon I can do a comeback on the golf course, just waiting for my children to enter the fariway.
